# Description
WE_Telegram_Bot  is a Python script that allows users to monitor their internet usage data from Telecom Egypt "WE".\
It provides both a standalone usage data retrieval functionality and the option to integrate with a Telegram bot for automated usage summaries every 2 hours and on-demand data checks.

The provided code fetches internet usage data from Telecom Egypt's API and generates a usage summary that includes the following information:
1. **Available Data**: The amount of available data in gigabytes (GB) from your total quota.
2. **Total Quota**: The total data quota you have subscribed to in GB.
3. **Used Data**: The amount of data you have already used in GB.
4. **Usage Percentage**: The percentage of your data quota that you have used.
5. **Remaining Days**: The number of days remaining until your data quota resets for renewal.

Here's an example of what the usage summary when printed:
``` 
___________________________
Available : 236.27 GB from 255.0 GB
Used : 18.73 GB
Usage percentage : 7.34 %
Remaining days : 27 days
___________________________
```
